# What is OOPS?
# A programming paradigm where everything is based on objects-instances of classes that bundle data and functions together.
# Example Objects = student, car, bank account ---- Attribute = data ---- Methods = actions


# Class and objects
# Class = blueprint or template
# Object = Actual instance made from the class
